Installation of OPC Service (Temporary until installer properly configured and tested once service finalized):
1) Run "Developer Command Prompt for VS" as administrator

2) Navigate to build (Either debug or release, whichever was built) folder for Artc.Harmony.UaWindowsService
E.g. "cd C:\Users\Andrew\Documents\Harmony\src\Edge\OpcUa\Artc.Harmony.UaWindowsService\bin\Debug"

3) Use installutil command to install service.
installutil -i OpcWindowsService.exe

4) Use installutil command to uninstall service once done.
installutil -u OpcWindowsService.exe


OpcEdgeClient:
1) Set Opc.EdgeClient as startup project in VS

2) Start once OpcWindowsService has been installed. (Client will not run if service has not been installed or is not running.)


Notes:
1) OpcWindowsService's MQTT client has been coded to auto-connect to "dev-harmony-01.southeastasia.cloudapp.azure.com:8080/mqtt"
This can be found in line 77 under OpcWindowsService.cs if change required.

2) OpcWindowsService's OPC client has been coded to auto-connect to last connected OPC endpoint (Unless no previous connection)
Retained endpoints will be stored as a .json file in a directory created by the service. (Line 26-29 and 626-650)
